## 🎛️ Manual Workflow Triggers

All workflows can be triggered manually through GitHub Actions with customizable parameters:

### Using GitHub CLI
```bash
# Trigger daily evolution
gh workflow run "Daily Evolution" \
  --field evolution_type=documentation \
  --field intensity=moderate \
  --field dry_run=false

# Trigger weekly health check
gh workflow run "Weekly Health Check" \
  --field check_type=comprehensive \
  --field generate_report=true \
  --field auto_fix=false

# Trigger monthly report
gh workflow run "Monthly Evolution Report" \
  --field report_type=comprehensive \
  --field include_predictions=true \
  --field generate_roadmap=true

# Trigger quarterly evolution
gh workflow run "Quarterly Major Evolution" \
  --field evolution_mode=strategic \
  --field focus_area=auto_detect \
  --field create_release=true
```

### Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select the desired workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Configure parameters as needed
5. Click **Run workflow** to start

## 📊 Monitoring and Reports

### Generated Reports
- **Daily**: Evolution logs and change summaries
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive health reports with metrics
- **Monthly**: Growth analytics with visualizations
- **Quarterly**: Strategic evolution documentation

### Report Locations
- `./reports/weekly/`: Health check reports and metrics
- `./reports/monthly/`: Evolution reports and analytics
- `./logs/`: Daily evolution and workflow logs

### Artifacts
Workflows generate downloadable artifacts containing:
- Detailed reports and analysis
- Performance metrics and charts  
- Evolution recommendations
- System health data

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Workflow Frequency
Edit the `cron` schedules in workflow files:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 3 * * *'  # Daily at 3 AM UTC
  - cron: '0 6 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sundays at 6 AM UTC
  - cron: '0 9 1 * *'  # Monthly on 1st at 9 AM UTC
  - cron: '0 12 1 1,4,7,10 *'  # Quarterly at 12 PM UTC
```

### Customize Evolution Behavior
Modify default parameters in workflow files:

```yaml
inputs:
  evolution_type:
    default: 'consistency'  # Change default behavior
  intensity:
    default: 'moderate'     # Adjust default intensity
```

### Add Custom Logic
Extend workflows by adding steps:

```yaml
- name: 🎨 Custom Enhancement
  run: |
    # Your custom logic here
    echo "Applying custom improvements..."
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Dry Run Mode
All workflows support dry run mode to preview changes:
```bash
gh workflow run "Daily Evolution" --field dry_run=true
```

### Error Recovery
Workflows include comprehensive error handling:
- Automatic cleanup on failure
- Error context capture
- Recovery attempt mechanisms
- Graceful degradation

### Rollback Protection
- Git history preservation
- Incremental change application
- Validation before commits
- Backup generation

## 📈 Growth Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Evolution Score**: Overall health and growth (0-100)
- **Growth Rate**: Month-over-month activity change
- **Health Trend**: System health direction
- **Activity Score**: Development velocity (0-100)

### Success Criteria
